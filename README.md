# Indian-Traffic-Segmentation
To perform Semantic(Image) Segmentation of Indian Traffic Images.

## Description:
Semantic segmentation, or image segmentation, is the task of clustering parts of an image together which belong to the same object class. It is a form of pixel-level prediction because each pixel in an image is classified according to a category. This project involves in segmenting the Indian Traffic Images obtained from the video which contains the traffic sites observed in various cities of India. This is implemented using U-Net architecture based Convolutional  Neural Network.
